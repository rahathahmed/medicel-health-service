    Site during pre-college years The college's original building was built
    before the Partition of Bengal of 1905. As of 1904, the building was being
    used as the secretariat (headquarters) of the newly formed provinces of East
    Bengal and Assam. In 1921, it was turned over to the University of Dhaka,
    which was founded that year. A part of the huge building was used as the
    university's medical center, another part as the students' dormitory, and
    the rest as s of DMC's earlier batches migrated
    from Calcutta Medical College.[12] Though Kolkata was officially known as
    Calcutta until 2001[13][14][15] the city was widely pronounced as
    Kolkata/Kolikata in Bengali. Though the first ten medical schools didn't
    follow this tradition, yet another theory proposes that, as the institute
    was the 11th medical school in Indian subcontinent, K, the 11th letter of
    English alphabet, is used to represent that .[10] Undergraduate course A
    countrywide combined medical admission test for MBBS course is held every
    year under the supervision of DGHS. Students after passing Higher Sfessional
    examinations, one at the end of each phase, are held under University of
    Dhaka. After passing the fourth or final professional examination, a student
    is awarded with MBBS degree. Course curriculum follows percentage system
    grading. Pass mark for the college's internal as well as professional
    examinations is 60 percent. Student shall have to pass written (MCQ + SAQ +
    formative), oral, practical and clinical examinations separately.[19]
    Students scoring 85 percent or above in a subject are awarded with
    honors.[citation needed]
